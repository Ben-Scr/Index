# BootstrapCMake.ps1 - Download + extract the portable Kitware CMake ZIP
# into vendor\cmake\. Called by scripts\dawn\BootstrapCMake.bat. Kept as a
# separate PowerShell file because embedding multi-line PowerShell inside
# a .bat (^ line-continuations + single-quoted strings + parens) confused
# cmd.exe's block parser, which silently corrupted SetupDawn.bat's control
# flow. The .bat wrapper is a thin shim; this script does the work.
