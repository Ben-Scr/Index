REM Verify that the Index-Launcher folder is shippable as a standalone zip.
REM Checks file presence directly under bin\<Config>-windows-x86_64\
REM Index-Launcher\ and inside the bundled EngineSDK so reach-backs into
REM the source tree are caught.
REM
REM This is a structural check only. The full clean-machine validation
REM must run on a separate Windows box with no source tree on disk, see
REM the plan's Verification section.
