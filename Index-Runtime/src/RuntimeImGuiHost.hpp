	//
	// First Acquire creates the ImGui context + GLFW/OpenGL backends and
	// raises the refcount; subsequent Acquires just bump the count. Release
	// decrements; the last Release tears the backends + context down. This
	// keeps the runtime free of "two layers fighting over ImGui::CreateContext"
	// and lets layer push order be arbitrary.
	//
	// All methods are main-thread only. Layer attach/detach already runs on
	// the main thread via Application's layer stack.

		// the host's reference counting ensures only the first BeginFrame
