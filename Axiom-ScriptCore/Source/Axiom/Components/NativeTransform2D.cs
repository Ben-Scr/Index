// Native (ECS pool-resident) view of the Transform 2D component. The managed

// underlying data; this struct is the zero-marshal hot-path view used by
// Entity.GetRef<NativeTransform2D>() / TransformRef / scene.QueryRef<...>.
//
// Layout MUST match Axiom-Engine/src/Components/General/Transform2DComponent.hpp
// (the C++ Transform2DComponent class). ScriptHostBridge enforces this at
// script-engine init by calling Entity_GetComponentSize("Transform 2D") and
// comparing against sizeof(NativeTransform2D) — a drift caught early hard-fails
// the user assembly load instead of silently corrupting EnTT storage.
//
// World-space fields (Position/Scale/Rotation) are written by
// TransformHierarchySystem each frame from the Local* values composed against
// the parent's world transform. Scripts that want their writes to stick
// across the next frame's hierarchy pass MUST write the Local* fields — the
// world fields are a derived cache. The C++ side's setters do this; the ref-API
// is more direct, so the convention is "edit LocalPosition, observe Position
// after the propagate pass."
