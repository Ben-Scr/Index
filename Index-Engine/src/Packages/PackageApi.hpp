// Shared API surface for Index packages.
//
// Every engine_core / standalone_cpp package compiles into its own SharedLib
// (`Pkg.<Name>.Native`). The runtime PackageHost LoadLibrary's the binary and
// resolves the standard entry points by name. Each package's TUs need to
// dllexport those entry points so GetProcAddress can find them.
//
// Including this header in a package source file gives it:
//   - INDEX_PACKAGE_API           — visibility macro for exported symbols.
//   - IndexPackage_OnLoad         — declared entry point (the package defines it).
//   - IndexPackage_OnUnload       — optional entry point.
//
// INDEX_PACKAGE_API is always export-side because this header is only included
// from package source. Consumers of a package's exports must use platform
// dlopen / GetProcAddress, not link-time imports.

#if defined(_WIN32)
    #define INDEX_PACKAGE_API __declspec(dllexport)
#else
    #define INDEX_PACKAGE_API __attribute__((visibility("default")))
