	// long-lived background tasks (file watching, async loaders), reach
	// for OwnedTask instead.
	//
	// Lifecycle: Initialize() must be called before any Job::Schedule /
	// ParallelFor call. Shutdown() drains pending work and joins all
	// workers. Calling Schedule from an uninitialized pool falls back to
	// running the work inline on the calling thread (defensive, so
	// shutdown ordering bugs don't crash — they merely serialize work).
	//
	// Thread-safety: every public method may be called from any thread.

		// this mid-frame is correct but may stall briefly. `workerCount`
