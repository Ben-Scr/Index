-- Tracy profiler client library.
--
-- Built only when the profiler is enabled (root premake5.lua sets
-- IndexProfiler.Enabled = true unless --no-profiler was passed). Compiled
-- as a SharedLib so the engine.dll, editor.exe, and runtime.exe all share
-- one Tracy client (Tracy is meant to have exactly one client per process,
-- and our three-binary split would otherwise risk duplicate registration).
--
-- Tracy v0.11.1's "fast integration" path is to compile a single source
-- file: External/tracy/public/TracyClient.cpp. Everything else is pulled
-- in by that TU.

    -- TRACY_ENABLE turns the macros into real instrumentation.
    -- TRACY_EXPORTS marks symbols dllexport on the build side; consumers
    -- get TRACY_IMPORTS to flip them to dllimport.
    -- TRACY_ON_DEMAND defers Tracy's internal sampling until a viewer
    -- actually connects over TCP. Without this, Tracy starts buffering
    -- zone events from process startup — even when no viewer is running —
    -- and the buffer grows indefinitely (we observed multi-GB RAM growth
    -- in long editor sessions). On-demand mode means: zero memory cost
    -- when no viewer is attached; full fidelity once one connects.
    -- IMPORTANT: this define must also be set on consumers (engine,
    -- editor, runtime, tests) so the Tracy headers compile the same
    -- code-paths on both sides — see Dependency.Profiler in
    -- Dependencies.lua for the consumer side.
