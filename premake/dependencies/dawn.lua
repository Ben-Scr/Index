-- Dawn (Google's WebGPU implementation) wiring.
--
-- Stage 1 of the WebGPU port (see Index-Engine/src/Graphics/Backend/WebGPUApi.cpp
-- for context). Dawn is built out-of-band by scripts/SetupDawn.bat or
-- scripts/SetupDawn.sh as a monolithic static library — premake does NOT compile
-- Dawn here. Dawn has hundreds of source files with CMake-driven codegen
-- (.h files emitted from .json descriptions of the WebGPU API surface); trying
-- to mirror that into premake would be a porting tax we'd pay every Dawn
-- update. Building Dawn via its own CMake once, then linking the resulting
-- webgpu_dawn.lib, is the supported pattern.
--
-- This file is included from premake5.lua when --rhi=webgpu is in effect.
-- It is intentionally NOT a premake `project` — there's nothing here for
-- premake to build. We instead export a small `DawnLayout` table the rest
-- of the build script (Dependencies.lua / Index-Engine/premake5.lua) reads
-- to inject Dawn's include + lib paths into the engine project.
--
-- If SetupDawn hasn't been run yet, the engine link step will fail with
-- "cannot open input file 'webgpu_dawn.lib'" — that's the trigger to run
-- SetupDawn.bat. We could fail earlier in premake itself by checking
-- os.isfile here, but a premake-time check is fragile across reconfigure-
-- before-build sequencing; the link-time failure message is clearer.

-- The extra Windows SDK libs cover Dawn's D3D11/D3D12 backends:
--   * dxguid.lib  -- WKPDID_D3DDebugObjectName (the debug-name marker
--     constant Dawn's SetDebugName helper attaches to D3D resources).
--   * onecore.lib -- CompareObjectHandles (Win 8.1+ kernel API Dawn uses
--     to compare D3D shared-fence handles in SharedFenceD3D11/12.cpp).
-- Both are header-only declarations; the actual symbols ship with the
-- Windows SDK and aren't auto-linked by default.

-- value-agnostic — defining it as `0` is still "defined" and trips the
-- dllimport path, which produces `__imp_wgpuCreateInstance` link errors
-- against the static webgpu_dawn.lib. Leaving it UNDEFINED is the correct
